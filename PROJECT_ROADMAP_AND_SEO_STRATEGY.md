## 3. The "Traffic Generation" Plan (Simple Words)

You asked: *"What is the blog for?"*

Think of the internet like a giant library. Right now, your website is a book on the shelf. But if nobody knows the book exists, nobody reads it.

**The Blog is how we tell the librarian (Google) what your book is about.**

### **Why Do We Need Blogs?**
When someone goes to Google and types: *"Can I notarize a will online in Florida?"*
*   If you maintain a **Service Page** that says "We do Wills," you *might* show up.
*   But if you have a **Blog Article** specifically titled *"How to Notarize a Will Online in Florida: A Step-by-Step Guide,"* you are **10x more likely** to show up #1.

**More Articles = More "Doorways" into your website.**
Each blog post is a new "door" that catches people searching for specific problems. Once they walk through the door (read the article), we invite them to hire you.

### **The "Authority" Strategy**
1.  **We Created 12 Starter Articles**: We have already written 12 professional articles for you (about Expats, Real Estate, Healthcare, etc.). This makes your site look "heavy" and authoritative to Google immediately.
2.  **Regular Updates**: Google loves "fresh" websites. By posting just 1-2 times a month, you tell Google, *"Heads up! We are still open and active!"*
3.  **Answering Questions**: We write about questions your clients actually ask.
    *   *Client asks*: "Do I need a lawyer for this?" -> *We write*: "When to hire a Notary vs. a Lawyer."
    *   *Client asks*: "Is this safe?" -> *We write*: "The Technology Behind Secure Online Notarization."

### **The Goal**
1.  User searches a question.
2.  User finds YOUR blog post.
3.  User sees you are an expert.
4.  User clicks "Get Notarized" and pays you.

## 4. Technical "Magic" We Implemented (SEO)
You don't need to worry about this, but your client will love to hear it:

*   **Speed**: Faster than 95% of other notary sites.
*   **Mobile First**: Looks perfect on iPhones (where 60% of traffic comes from).
*   **Structured Data**: We labeled your site's code so Google knows your "Opening Hours," "Phone Number," and "Location" automatically.

This is a complete, "Turn-Key" business solution.
