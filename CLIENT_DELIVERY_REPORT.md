## 📰 What is the Blog? (Simple Explanation for Non-Technical Clients)

### **Think of Google as a Giant Library**
Right now, your website is like a book sitting on a shelf. But if nobody knows the book exists, nobody reads it.

### **The Blog = Your Megaphone to Google**
Every blog post you publish is like putting up a **new billboard** on the internet highway. When someone searches Google for:
- *"How to notarize a will online in Florida?"*
- *"Can I get documents notarized from Spain?"*
- *"What is an apostille?"*

...your blog articles will show up and bring them to YOUR website.

### **Why We Created 12 Articles for You**
We've already written **12 professional, SEO-optimized articles** covering the most common questions your clients ask. This gives you an instant "head start" with Google.

**The 12 Articles We Created:**
1. Future of Notarization: Why RON is Taking Over
2. How to Notarize Documents from Abroad
3. Mobile Notary vs. Remote Online Notary
4. 5 Mistakes to Avoid When Notarizing Loan Documents
5. Understanding Apostilles: When You Need One
6. Notary Responsibilities in Real Estate
7. Digital Security: Keeping Your Data Safe
8. Notarizing Wills and Trusts for Seniors
9. After-Hours Mobile Notary Benefits
10. Corporate Solutions: Bulk Authentications
11. Validity of Electronic Signatures
12. Your Online Notary Session Guide

### **How This Brings You Clients**
1. Someone searches Google → Finds your article
2. They read it and think: *"Wow, these people know what they're doing!"*
3. They click "Get Notarized" → You get a new client

**Recommendation**: Publish 1-2 new articles per month to keep Google interested.
